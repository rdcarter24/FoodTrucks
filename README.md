I originally made an app that sends a text message when it's time to leave to catch a BART train but didn't feel it satisfied the requirements of the challenge.  The backend of this app can be found here, https://github.com/rdcarter24/CatchTrain  

Also, please see my Hackbright project which is an app that uses machine learning to generate an original yoga routine
